# Imperial Year 3 Notes
A list of .pdf files with LaTex notes for the following modules (for now):

Disclaimer - these are my personal notes, and they may contain wrong/misleading information. All credit goes to the various course instructors.

The first set of notes will be made available by 20/10/2024, for IML and DPS. NS and TPCP will follow by 27/10/2024. Following that, each will be maintained weekly and updates will happen (hopefully) within 2 days of new lectures being released.
Source code for files available on request.
